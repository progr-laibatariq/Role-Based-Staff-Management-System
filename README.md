# Role-Based-Staff-Management-System
Java-based role-driven staff management system demonstrating OOP design, modular architecture, and file-based persistence.

## Overview:

The Role-Based Staff Management System is a console-based Java application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system models an academic or organizational environment where staff members are managed based on their roles, such as instructors, department heads, administrators, and managers.

The project focuses on clean code structure, modular design, and role-based organization, providing a strong foundation for understanding real-world system design.

## Features:

Role-based staff hierarchy (Instructor, HOD, Admin Officer, Department Manager)

Staff record management

Attendance tracking with persistent file storage

Salary computation using separate business logic

Console-based, menu-driven interaction

Modular and extensible design

## Technologies Used:

Java (Object-Oriented Programming)

File Handling (for attendance records)

Console / Command-Line Interface

## Key Concepts Demonstrated:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Inheritance and polymorphism

Encapsulation and separation of concerns

Role-based system modeling

File-based data persistence

## How to Run the Project:

Clone the repository or download the source code.

Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).

Ensure all .java files are in the same package (or default package).

Run the Run.java file.

Follow the console menu to interact with the system.

## Future Improvements:

User authentication and authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Secure storage of records

Input validation and logging

Database integration (MySQL)
